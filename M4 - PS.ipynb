    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Background:**<br/>\n",
    "The first FIFA World Cup was held in July 1930, in Uruguay. Much has changed since the contest's first incarnation. The game itself is the same, but the stage and the stakes are far greater.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2018 edition was recently held in Russia. Thirty-two qualifying nations competed for the ultimate prize (from a pool of 209 eligible countries). Budget estimates for the contest range from \\$10 to \\$20 billion. According to some publications, the audience topped 3.4 billion viewers over the entire period.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tournament is divided into 2 stages – the group stage and the knockout stage. In the group stage, teams within each group play each other once. At the end of this stage, the top two teams from each group proceed to the knockout stage. From here on, each team plays one other team. If the team wins, it qualifies for the next round, else it gets eliminated from the tournament.  In all 64 for matches were disputed across Russia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**<br/>\n",
    "Our project objective is to build a model to predict 2018 World Cup match outcomes. The model’s accuracy will be measured based on the percentage of outcomes it predicts correctly, and will be compared to a simple baseline model, as well as a model reflecting historical outcomes (e.g. 45% home wins, 30% home losses, 25% home draws).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**<br/>\n",
    "We will start with a baseline model including historical match results, FIFA rankings and a few additional features gathered from on-line sources.  Once the baseline is in place, we will enhance it through an iterative process. Relevant features will be added to the model as we explore additional data sources and review findings.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this objective, we will be building three models:\n",
    " - **Average model**: a model predicting match outcomes based on historical average of home wins, losses and draws.\n",
    " - **Baseline model**: simple model including FIFA ranking points and a few additional features gathered from the EA Sports FIFA video game. This model will rely on a limited set of modeling approaches.\n",
    " - **Full model**: a more advanced model based additional on features, and a wider array of modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**<br/>\n",
    "The task at hand is quite challenging, for several reasons:\n",
    " - **The \"best\" team doesn't always win**: sporting events are popular and exciting in part because the outcome of the contest isn't pre-determined.  While it is true that the better teams tend to rise to the top over the course of an extended season, individual contests are much more difficult to predict.  The figure below shows historical match outcomes relative to FIFA ranking points.  Very imbalanced contests tend to result in predictable match outcomes, but the picture is less clear when teams are closer.\n",
    " \n",
    " <img style=\"float: center\" src=\"images/PJ1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **The World Cup is unlike most other contests**:\n",
    "     - Home vs. Away: when looking at historical match results dataset, we observe that most matches are played on one of the the team's home soil.  This is not the case in the World Cup, where only the host nation has that advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Assessing team strength_: our goal is incorporate some form of team strength feature into the model. Depending on our approach, this may require finding historical national roster information, or perhaps creating a positions-based algorithm to score the team, based on player selection assumptions.\n",

    "**Data & Features:**\n",
    " - _**Team FIFA Ranking**:_ FIFA team rankings\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Team strength**_: a measure of team strength based on player and/ or aggregated position scores\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Team Payroll**_: sum of player salaries\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Team Average Age**_: average of player ages\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Number of UEFA Players on Team**:_ count of UEFA players on national team\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**International Competition Record**_: a measure of team success between 2014 and 2018 world cup (excluding friendlies)\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Recent World Cup Appearances**_: number of appearances in the previous two or three FIFA World Cups\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Total World Cup Titles**_: total number of FIFA World Cup titles\n",
    "\n",
    " - _**Proximity to Home Country**_: distance of match venue from home country (could impact fan attendance)\n",
    " \n",
    " - _**Home/Away Continent**_: venue continent vs team continent (may affect player comfort)\n",
    " \n",
    " -  _**Weather**_: weather in match venue\n",
    " \n",
    " -  _**Previous WC Winner**_: recently, previous tournament winners have fared poorly in the following cup\n",
    " \n",
    " -  _**Team Chemistry Score**_: positively affected if players are on the same league team, negatively if players are on different teams in the same league\n",
